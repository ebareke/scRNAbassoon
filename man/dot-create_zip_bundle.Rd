\title{Create ZIP Bundle of Analysis Results}
\usage{
.create_zip_bundle(out_dir)
}
\arguments{
\item{out_dir}{Character. Output directory containing analysis results to compress}
}
\value{
NULL (invisible). Creates ZIP file as side effect.
}
\description{
Internal function that compresses all analysis outputs into a single ZIP
archive for easy sharing, archiving, or transfer.
}
\details{
This function:
\itemize{
\item Recursively collects all files from the output directory
\item Creates a ZIP archive named "Complete_Analysis.zip"
\item Places the ZIP file in the root of the output directory
\item Overwrites existing ZIP if present
\item Handles errors gracefully without stopping the pipeline
}

The resulting ZIP archive contains the complete directory structure with
all plots, tables, and R objects, making it ideal for:
\itemize{
\item Sharing results with collaborators
\item Long-term archiving of complete analyses
\item Transferring to computing clusters or cloud storage
\item Creating analysis snapshots at different time points
}
}
\section{File Size}{

The ZIP file size depends on:
\itemize{
\item Number of plots generated
\item Plot format (PDF vs PNG vs both)
\item Size of Seurat object (cell count)
\item Number of DE comparisons
}

Typical sizes range from 50 MB to several GB for large datasets.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Typically called automatically by run_bassoon_pipeline
# when zip_outputs = TRUE

# Can also be called manually after analysis
.create_zip_bundle("/path/to/results/")
# Creates: /path/to/results/Complete_Analysis.zip
}
